# Load-Balancing-with-AWS-Application-Load-Balancer
I recently set up an Application Load Balancer (ALB) in AWS to distribute traffic across multiple EC2 instances. Hereâ€™s a look at the process, definitions, and some advantages!

**What is a Load Balancer**? ðŸ¤”
A Load Balancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets (like EC2 instances), increasing availability, scalability, and fault tolerance. By balancing load, it prevents any one instance from becoming a bottleneck, ensuring high performance for users. ðŸš€

**Advantages of Load Balancers:**
1. **High Availability**: Spreads traffic across instances in multiple Availability Zones, minimizing downtime.
2. **Scalability**: Automatically adapts to fluctuations in traffic.
3. **Fault Tolerance**: Keeps applications running even if an instance goes down by rerouting traffic to healthy instances.
